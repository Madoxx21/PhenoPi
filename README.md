# 🌿 PhenoPi

**PhenoPi** is a prototype computer vision application designed to monitor and analyze plant development using AI-based image analysis. It provides tools and pipelines for plant phenotyping tasks such as leaf segmentation, instance detection, and growth tracking.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🌱 **Plant Phenotyping:** Automated analysis of plant growth and development over time.
* 🧠 **AI-Powered:** Uses cutting-edge models like **Mask R-CNN**, **Mask2Former**, **YOLOv8**, and **SAM** (Segment Anything Model).
* 🔍 **Segmentation & Detection:** Multiple pipelines for leaf segmentation, instance recognition, and watershed analysis.
* 📊 **Data Preprocessing & Analysis:** Tools for preparing and interpreting image data.
* 🧪 **Notebook-Based:** Modular and easy-to-follow Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and customization.
